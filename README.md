# Mesuring-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble
This is about my experimental project done in my third year of Licence de Physique Ã  l'UBO.

Me and my pair, with our referent professor, tried to mesure the pressure inside a soap bubble with a MEMS pressure captor, but after some experiment, we came back on the indirect method due to the high sensibility of the MEMS captor and the high nose of the wintery weather.
